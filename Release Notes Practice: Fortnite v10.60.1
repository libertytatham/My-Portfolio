You've loved makeshift bow's long range and ease of aiming, but now we've made them even better with crafting! Use materials from around the map to make a variety of bows that are stronger and have different effects when shooting. Test it out at any upgrade bench and see for yourself!

### Show you're out of this world with the new Galaxy skin!

The skin you almost purchased a new Samsung Galaxy for (even though you're more of an Apple fan), now out of the vault and for sale in the store for only 200,000 v-bucks. What a steal!

## What's Improved

* Improved cross-console game play. Matches will now be built by evenly distributing users from each console to compensate for ease of gameplay on certain consoles. No one is OP here!
* Lowered the shooting range on DMRs from 40 tiles to 35
* Raised the headshot damage for DMRs net +30 points
* Increase network update rates - NPCs will now move as smoothly as players.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue that caused lagging for users upon landing when thanking the bus driver (Please, thank your drivers).
* Fixed a bug that resulted in low resolution for Nintendo Switch players when playing in Battle Royale mode.
* Added expeted sound effect that was missing from pickaxes this season.
* Fixed issue of tamed wildlife taking less damage when hit, all wildlife now take the same damage within their species whether tamed or wild.
