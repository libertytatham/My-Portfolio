# A Revelation
By Liberty Tatham

She is a treasure,
Hidden but worth every effort to find.
In the aftermath of the battle, you are defeated and feel small,
She soldiers you up for a rally. 
After the win she congratulates you, taking no credit for herself. 
In the hustle of the crowd, you trip and skin your knees,
You find her at your side; you feel safe to laugh with her,
She lifts you up and your wounds are healed. 
In the middle of the night, she sees you. 
She sees the beauty of your silhouette in the moonlight, and gently wipes your tears,
She knows how you want to be held until you drift back to sleep. 
Like a healing balm,
She soothes without sting.
Like a saint,
She saves without price. 
But where is she hidden?
Somewhere within.
