# What's a chargeback?
Things are going well in your business! Sales are good, customers enjoy your products, and you've been able to resolve customer issues easily. But one day, you get a notification you don't understand--you have a chargeback! What does this mean for you and your business? What can you do about it?

## What does "chargeback" mean?
A chargeback, sometimes known as a dispute, is a forced refund to the customer initiated by their card network. If you've received a chargeback, that means the cardholder (usually the customer) had an issue with the purchase and is requesting their money back.

## What are the consequences of chargebacks?
Chargebacks can be devastating if not managed, especially for small businesses. The obvious consequences are lost revenue, processing fees, and time dedicated to chargebacks that could have been spent on business development. However, if a business receives excessive chargebacks, consequences include:
* large fines when the chargeback rate exceeds the threshold (which is usually defined as >1% of all transactions and is calculated monthly). This fee can be upwards of $10,000.
* Payment processors can terminate a merchant's account if the chargeback rate exceeds the threshold for an extended period of time, sometimes even years.

Clearly, it's important to manage chargebacks using both defense (representment) and offense (prevention strategies).

## What can I do about a chargeback?
Once a chargback is initiated, you have a couple of options to resolve:

### 1. Accept the chargeback
If you see a chargeback and realize the customer is right and needs a refund, accept the chargeback.

Once a chargeback is initiated, it isn't possible to refund the customer using traditional methods. Therefore, you must accept the chargeback in order to return the funds to the customer.

### 2. Fight the chargeback
If you feel the customer's claim is wrong, you can fight the chargeback. In the chargebacks management industry, this is called a representment. You represent a chargeback by submitting a rebuttal letter and compelling evidence in response to the notification you received. Your argument can (and should!) vary depending on the reason code associated with the chargeback and the specific situation.

## What's a reason code?
You'll notice on the notification of your chargeback that there is a reason code associated with the chargeback. The reason code tells you the reason why the cardholder is disputing the charge. The verbiage and numerical code vary by card network, but they all fit into general categories. These categories include fraud, goods not received, defective goods/goods not as described, cancelled merchandise, etc. 

There are lots of great resources online to better understand the specific reason code. Two that are particularly user friendly are [Chargebacks 911](https://chargebacks911.com/chargeback-reason-codes/) and [Chargeback Gurus](https://www.chargebackgurus.com/chargeback-reason-codes). 

## Guidelines for representing a chargeback
There's an entire industry of experts dedicated to representing chargebacks. There are a lot of rules and nuances set by card networks, and the rules even vary depending on the card network. If you find yourself deep in the weeds of chargebacks and need expertise, there are plenty of chargeback management services you can hire to represent chargebacks for you. Some payment processors even offer it for free or as an affordable add-on. But, if you decide you need to take care of the chargeback on your own, here are some general guidelines.

- Fight the chargeback prior to the deadline. The notification you received includes a deadline. If the chargeback expires, the customer will be rewarded the funds. Be sure to represent the chargeback before the deadline!
- Gather compelling evidence as to why the cardholder's claim is incorrect. Again, which evidence to include varies by reason code, card network, and situation. But, most chargebacks require the following information at minimum:
⋅⋅⋅ * Invoice
⋅⋅⋅ * Proof of delivery
⋅⋅⋅ * Correspondence with the customer
- Create a rebuttal letter succintly outlining why the claim is invalid, how you fulfilled your obligation to the customer, and what you did to rectify the situation before the chargeback occurred.
- Submit your representment to the card network. There are instructions for submission on the notification.
- As you receive updates from the card network, stay on top of them. Updates can include requests for more information and representment results.

## Guidelines for preventing chargebacks
While you cannot ensure you never receive a chargeback, you can do your best to prevent them. You can prevent chargebacks by having a great customer service team, keeping very thorough documentation on every order you fulfill, ensuring your billing descriptors are clear so customers understand charges easily, and using a fraud prevention system. If you find an influx of chargebacks coming in, investigate these areas of your business and see what can be improved.

We hope that this guide gives you some information to get started and take control of chargebacks!
